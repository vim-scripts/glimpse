Glimpse is a powerful indexing and query system, free for personal use.
	http://www.webglimpse.net

VimGlimpse is a basic Glimpse interface within Vim, based on a Vim Tip from
Jean-Rene David. 
	http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_glimpse_from_within_Vim

VimGlimpse retains normal Vim :grep functionality, and provides
additional Glimpse features outside of what :grepprg can allow.  By
default, VimGlimpse only searches within your current working directory,
making it ideal for near instantaneous searches across a project.

Examples:

    :Glimpse porksausage

		Find porksausage across all files in the current working directory.

    :Glimpse needle haystack.h$

		Finds all needles in all haystack.h's files.

	:let g:glimpseFlags = "-iny -2"
	:Glimpse Anestesiology html 

		Outputs all occurrences of  Anestesiology  with  two  errors  in
		files with html somewhere in their full name.

	:Glimpse windsurfing;Arizona mail;1993

		Finds  all lines containing windsurfing and Arizona in all files
		having `mail' and '1993' somewhere in their full name.

Results are placed into the |quickfix| window.  Additionally, the 'q' key is
bound to the window so you can close it again quickly.
